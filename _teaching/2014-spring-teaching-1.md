***Summer 2024***

I joined UIU as a full-time lecturer on July 06, 2024. I was assigned Digital Logic Design Course for three undergraduate students sections in my debut trimester. I also conducted Digital Logic Design Laboratory for two sections. The topics cover different aspects of digital electronics. Even though the syllabus is very large, the contents themselves are enjoyable.
