**Abstract:** Ensuring agro-farm security has become a paramount challenge in the context of Bangladesh’s growing agricultural sector. In response to the escalating challenges of theft and aggressive activities plaguing agricultural farms in Bangladesh, this research presents an innovative IoT-based smart agro-farm security system. Through comprehensive system design, program development, and testing, the system detects unauthorised access and  triggers alarms, sending real-time notifications to the farmer’s house and mobile device. The system consists of a sender station (farm shed) and two receiver stations (farmer’s house and mobile device). The sender station integrates a range of sensors (laser and vibration sensors), including GSM and a transceiver controlled by an Arduino Mega. The receiver stations comprise an Arduino UNO, indicator lights, high-sound alarms, and remote  access on the farmer’s mobile device. Testing showed 100% responsiveness for the laser sensor and 90% for the vibration sensor. This system went through a rigorous process of testing which resulted in an overall system efficiency of 90%. This innovative solution empowers farmers and agro-farm entrepreneurs to protect their valuable assets, contributing to enhanced farm security in Bangladesh and promoting agricultural industry 
sustainability.
