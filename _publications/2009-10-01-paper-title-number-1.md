**Abstract:** The diagnosis of fungal infections is quite challenging because of their wide-ranging symptoms and characteristics.
Different fungi species are typically categorized using manual
microscopical techniques, which are ostensibly prone to some
degree of subjectivity. Deep learning models have been employed
in computer-assisted diagnostic systems in recent years for quick
and precise mycological diagnosis. This study represents an
automatic detection of fungi species in microscopic images using
the vision transformer (ViT) architecture and transfer learning-based technique. The dataset in this study includes microscopic
image samples of five distinct fungal species. First, a vision
transformer network is trained and validated on the dataset,
achieving 83.12% accuracy with decent precision, recall, and
F1 score. The concept of transfer learning is then utilized by
adding pre-trained modelsâ€”VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50,
separately in parallel with the ViT network, where features
extracted using the transfer learning technique fine-tune and
improve the overall performance of the ViT network. Our study
finds the ViT with ResNet50 model as the top-performing model,
with an enhanced performance of 90.13% accuracy on the
same dataset with 91.22% precision, 89.70% recall, and 90.91%
F1 Score. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in precisely categorizing fungi species.
