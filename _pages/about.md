:microphone: I'm **Osama** (he/him), a fresh graduate from the *department of CSE, BUET*. I am currently working as a full-time lecturer in the *department of CSE, United International University*. My research interests lie in the fields of **Computational Biology, Bioinformatics**, as well as **Machine Learning**. My current career goal is to pursue a PhD program in my field of interest.


:mag_right: My **undergraduate thesis** project was under Dr. Md. Sohel Rahman titled "**Modeling Temporal Dependencies and Feature Interactions Reveal Novel Clinical and Molecular Insights into Alzheimer’s Disease Progression**". We attempted to interpret top Alzheimer’s disease prediction models from the TADPOLE Challenge. For XGBoost model, we analyzed feature interactions with the help of TreeSHAP method. For complex deep learning model like RNN, we incorporated Integrated Gradient, which required modification in the model architecture. We found that with the ablation of top two performing biomarkers, we were able to find more insightful results depicting the relationship between clinical and molecular features. We also found that feature importances have their own temporal dependencies. The results will help us generalize more impactful trial design based on patient status and diagnosis period or timeline.

:mag_right: I am also doing a research project under Dr. A. B. M. Alim Al Islam on **Remodelling DhakaSIM, a traffic simulator based on heterogeneous non-lane based road network like Dhaka, incorporating side-friction elements**. We collected Google Earth data and analyzed the road-blockage of different side friction elements. Prior studies did not take these elements into account as they are largly found in heterogeneous traffic network like in South Asian countries. We attempted to improve the existing **DhakaSIm**, a traffic simulator based on Dhaka's heterogeneous system by incorporating these side friction elements, and finally showed that by doing so, the performance metrics align more with the true Google Map data.

:books: Apart from my research, I am also fortunate enough to contribute to the academic community through teaching. I’m currently the instructor of undergraduate-level courses on Structural Programming Language, Digital Logic Design, Artificial Intelligence, Discrete Mathematics etc.

:game_die:As an undergrad student at BUET, I've participated in Studnet poster presentations and secured first place back to back in the International Conference on Networking, Systems and
Security (NSysS)
. I also participated in multiple case competitions. My dream is to pursue academia and continue doing research. I love everything about mathematics, which is why solving analytical problems, algorithms and ML modelling are somethings I find very enjoyable.

:basketball: :musical_note: :clapper: I also love music, travelling, basketball, chess and binge-watching TV series and anime.
